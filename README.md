# Editable Ad Banners

This is is a Next.js + Typescript Application that displays some Ad Banners & allows users to edit them in real-time.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository into your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

2. Then install all dependencies, by running the following commands in project's root directory (where package.json file is available)

```bash
npm i
# or
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Third step is to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`.
